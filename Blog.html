                <h2>Will AUKUS Actually Deliver For Australia?</h2>
                <h3><em>(15/04/2025)</em></h3>
                <p>I remember in my later high school years when the Attack Class deal was cancelled and AUKUS was 
                    announced the many uproars from classmates (who, like me, had admittedly a naïve understanding of 
                    defence and geopolitics) that abandoning France and spending all this money on a new program was 
                    a waste of money. Money, which they thought would be better spent on the nebulous slogans of “the 
                    cost of living crisis” or “the NDIA backlog”. It is only natural for people to feel this way, why 
                    should we commit billions of dollars to programs which ostensibly don’t affect us directly, we will 
                    never see, and many say will never use.
                </p>
                <p>It’s this attitude, however, that underpins the Australian population’s general apathy towards defence. 
                    And it is that concern which drives me to give an overview of just how important a move like this is for 
                    Australia’s standing in the region, a region which grows more uncertain by the month. This will neither be 
                    a comprehensive look at either the agreement itself, the ‘Pillars’ or the submarines themselves, but instead 
                    a broad outline, responding to two major questions that underpin consideration of AUKUS’ effectiveness. Those 
                    big questions are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Whether both the Virginia Class SSNs and AUKUS Class SSNs will actually be delivered?</li>
                    <li>Will our acquisition of nuclear submarines answer Australia’s strategic concerns?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Will it actually <em>be</em> delivered?</h3>
                <h4>Viriginia Class</h4>
                    <p>A key component of the agreement which has, and will be, on the tongues of all commentators is Australia’s 
                        acquisition of three, with the possibility of two more Virginia Class SSNs (short for Ship Submersible Nuclear i.e. nuclear subs.) Such a purchase raises 
                        concerns as to whether the American military shipbuilding industry will be able to handle a loss of 
                        upwards of 20% of its expanding Virginia fleet. Such a depletion has already accelerated contracts to 
                        expand its own Virginia fleet and especially, many wonder whether the industry, following a slowdown during 
                        COVID, can handle that as well as an additional Virginia Block VII submarine purpose-built for Australia.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, this anxiety can quite easily be put to rest by the fact that both parties across the ocean agree 
                        that a revitalisation of US shipbuilding is critical. President Trump, in an attempt to boost American 
                        commercial and military maritime industries, pledged tax incentives for domestic companies as well as a 
                        USD$1.5 million fee on Chinese ships coming to the US. Similarly, Australia’s commitment to give USD$3 billion 
                        over four years to help US Virginia shipbuilding can put most at ease that, unless something catastrophic like 
                        COVID were to occur again, American ships will be christened at much faster rates and a delivery of the 
                        purchased subs to Australia is almost certain.
                    </p>
                <h4>AUKUS Class</h4>
                    <p>A perhaps more tentative hope rests on the ability for UK dockyards to handle the construction of a whopping 
                        three classes: Astute, Dreadnought, and AUKUS. All of this coming at a time when Britain certainly isn’t 
                        sending fleets of battleships and heavy cruisers down the Clyde like it once might have. That is to say, 
                        the glory days of the Grand Fleet are over and submarine production has certainly been the victim of austere 
                        measures that have scaled down the Royal Navy to a comparatively weak posture. This raises the concern as 
                        to whether the sub-building hub at Barrow will be capable of handling the pressures of the AUKUS agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although certainly a more credible compromising piece to the integrity of the agreement, what can potentially 
                        alleviate this are a number of different factors. First is that, with the seemingly constant stream of 
                        nuclear submarine production, it can be hoped that the workers and specialists will both be more willing to 
                        stay with the shipyards as well as transfer skills between already similar platforms. Second, the modular 
                        design of the AUKUS Class allows for large parts of construction as well as the entire assembly to occur 
                        domestically in Australia, relieving the pressure on Barrow and allowing it to focus its attention on not 
                        only the Astute and Dreadnought Classes, but also their own domestically made AUKUS submarines. Finally, a 
                        similar commitment from Australia of AUD$4 billion over four years to British submarine shipbuilding will 
                        also, like for the US, help rejig maritime production to standards that will allow it to meet such a large 
                        order. With that, it can be more hopeful that the production of submarines will be followed through on.
                    </p>
                <h3>Will the program actually answer Australia's Strategic Concerns?</h3>
                <h4>Timeline</h4>
                    <p>A key accusation of many is that such a deal leaves Australia quite exposed, waiting another ~7 years until 
                        we get the Virginias and at the minimum ~15–20 years until we start getting AUKUS subs into the water. Such 
                        a gap leaves ample exploitable time in the event of a regional crisis. However, all the talk of “War and 
                        invasion imminent!” seems mainly to just be coming from hawkish, warmongering types. Such people have been 
                        heralding doomsday within the year since 2019 (as far back as I can remember), and nothing has come from 
                        it. Whilst the Russian invasion of Ukraine certainly came as a shock to many, a similar conflict erupting 
                        within the decade, especially at a time when America and the West in general aren’t scaling back their 
                        militaries like they once might have, is just infeasible. With that, the gap until Virginia acquisition 
                        seems less of a gaping hole and more of a small hole that will quietly be filled in a short time.
                    </p>
                    <p>A more pressing concern though is 15–20 years into the future. I don’t want to begin speculating, but one 
                        only needs to look at the 19th century to know that great powers and world orders can dramatically change 
                        within the span of decades. The world of now and the 2040s will certainly look different, and it is more 
                        uncertain whether, by that time, completion of the planned AUKUS subs will be possible. Hopefully, Rotational 
                        Force West and East might provide a stopgap in the meantime. The rotational forces outline a number of US 
                        and UK SSNs to be in constant rotation in Australian ports, mainly for training purposes, but in the event 
                        of a crisis, could be deployed as a fast response force. That would potentially shore up the time in acquiring 
                        AUKUS SSNs and ensure a potent naval deterrent in the region for the foreseeable decades.
                    </p>
                <h4>The SSN Capability</h4>
                    <p>A discussion of the intricacies of both the Virginia and AUKUS submarines is out of the scope of this but two 
                        qualities, namely indiscretion and range, are key to understanding the deal's importance to Australia’s naval buildup.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Discretion</h5>
                        <p>The indiscretion rate of a submarine simply means the time that it has to spend in a compromised state, or one 
                        that leaves it vulnerable to detection. Indiscrete actions may include either directly surfacing or near-surfacing 
                        for periscoping or snorkelling. With no need to snorkel like all diesel submarines, SSNs simply provide unparalleled 
                        secrecy. This means they can operate almost entirely underwater with no need to surface. Recent news like a 204-day-long 
                        patrol of a UK Astute Class SSN goes to show that nuclear technology is a quantum leap in the capability for submarines 
                        to operate without detection. Rates like this make orbital and surface detection almost impossible and mean SSNs can 
                        patrol anywhere with much greater operational security, leaving the door open for more attack opportunities.
                        </p>
                    <h5>Range</h5>
                        <p>Nuclear Submarines, by their very nature, have practically unlimited power until the fuel rods run out after 30 or 
                            so years, only hampered by the capacity for provisions. And with a propulsion system that is entirely air-independent, 
                            SSNs can deliver a potent maritime force almost anywhere. What this does is extend on the Collins class’s relatively 
                            weak range of 9,000 nautical miles at periscope depth and allows Australia to operate a submarine force anywhere in 
                            the Indo-Pacific region. This has the possibility to place serious threat to vital avenues of commercial trade as 
                            well as allowing operational flexibility otherwise unthinkable for the Collins.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Strait of Malacca sees ~60% of Chinese trade (especially oil from the Middle East). Although a shift from Saudi 
                            Arabian to Russian oil is already underway, Saudi Arabia is unlikely to stop being a vital part of Chinese imports 
                            any time soon. That, as well as other trade around the world, means that if Australia were to take advantage of this 
                            weakness, it could put major strain on Chinese civilian and warfighting capabilities. Even just the presence of such 
                            a capability would seriously hamper Chinese attempts to safely conduct military operations in the region. Even with 
                            a rapidly developing Chinese Anti-Submarine Warfare program, it will take time to see whether this will be enough. 
                            Additionally, with the discretion that an SSN provides, it has the potential to be a major player in the balance 
                            of power in a regional crisis.
                        </p>
                        <p>Such opportunities can only be afforded with the range of a nuclear submarine and place in the hands of Australia a 
                            seriously powerful armament.
                        </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>In the end, whilst the practical implications of such a deal lay out of the eyes of most in the public, what cannot be 
                        debated is the unprecedented leap that Australia is being afforded with such an acquisition. Will they be delivered? 
                        Speculation into the 2040s may be too long off but the Virginias and a constant presence of SSNs in the region for the 
                        foreseeable future is for sure. What do they provide? Only one of the most important developments in Australia’s maritime 
                        history, giving secrecy and range that otherwise would have been unthinkable. Ultimately though, Australia is finally 
                        being recognised as a major regional naval power, capable of wielding a force that will be a force to be reckoned with 
                        in the future.
